// MARK: - Plan Components Overview
/*
 Plan Components are specific to the Plan step in MindPath:
 
 1. TaskStepBox - Shows current task and step progress
 2. TaskSuggestionsCard - Provides smart suggestions for task planning
 3. TaskLocationSelector - Allows selection of work location
 4. TaskTimeScheduler - Handles task scheduling and timing
 5. TaskEnvironmentPreparation - Helps prepare the work environment
 6. TaskFocusModeSelector - Selects focus conditions for the task
 
 These components are not atomic/reusable as they are specifically designed
 for the Plan step workflow and contain business logic specific to task planning.

// MARK: - Usage Example
/*
 To use these components in PlanScreen.swift:
 
 import SwiftUI
 
 struct PlanScreen: View {
     var body: some View {
         VStack {
             TaskStepBox(
                 currentTask: "Open your FAFSA email",
                 currentStep: 1,
                 totalSteps: 4,
                 showSecondaryAction: true
             )
             
             TaskSuggestionsCard(
                 onRegenerate: {
                     // Handle regenerate
                 }
             )
             
             TaskLocationSelector { location in
                 // Handle location selection
             }
             
             TaskTimeScheduler(
                 onLaunchNow: {
                     // Handle immediate launch
                 },
                 onScheduleFor: { date in
                     // Handle scheduled date
                 },
                 onSuggestionSelected: { suggestion in
                     // Handle time suggestion
                 }
             )
             
             TaskEnvironmentPreparation(
                 onEnvironmentChanged: { text in
                     // Handle environment text
                 },
                 onSuggestionSelected: { suggestion in
                     // Handle environment suggestion
                 }
             )
             
             TaskFocusModeSelector { focusMode in
                 // Handle focus mode selection
             }
         }
     }
 }
